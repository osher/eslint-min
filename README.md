Minimal rules for Maximum Impact, for minimalist code.

# philosophy 

## Minimize code

- Less to read = less to parse in your brain
- Less to write = less to maintain

In general, if a chacacter is not necessary - it should not be there.

Exceptions: `comma-dangling`, to minimize impact on diffs.

## Don't block programmers: Let Programmers Grow

Don't stupidify programmers.
 - Don't limit them primitive constructs, expecially if these constracts take
     more lines to write.
 - Let programmers grow and learn, and be able to understand more.
 - Require programmers develop the thinking instinct.

## Hunman over Machine
 - Humans appreciate aesthetics. Machines dont
 - Clarity of code is not guaranteed by anal rules. It's clear if if it passes review.
